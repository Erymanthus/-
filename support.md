<cj>Thanks for using the Streak Mod!</cj> 

This mod is a personal project made with a lot of <cp>effort and dedication</c> in my free time.

If you enjoy the features and want to support its development, any donation is welcome! Donations directly help cover:

## Why Donate?

* <cy>Server Costs:</c> Keeping the server online (<cl>Render</c> and potentially <co>Firebase</c>) has operational expenses that increase with more players. Your support helps keep it fast and available for everyone.

* <cg>Development Time:</c> Creating, improving, and fixing bugs in the mod takes up <cp>many hours</c>. Donations allow me to dedicate more time to it and keep adding new things.

* <cb>New Features:</c> I have lots of ideas for the future! Your contribution helps make new features, improvements, and more content for the mod a reality.
